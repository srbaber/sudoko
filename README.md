# sudoku
simple suduku solver

due to licencing requirements I cannot provide the JavaFX runtime to run the UI
if you want to run the UI, you will need the JavaFX runtime with Java 11 from:
https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
Version 17.0.12 SDK

and extract it into ./native/ so that you have:
./native/javafx-sdk-17.0.12/lib
